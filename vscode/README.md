# VSCode: Visual Studio Code

`VSCode` is a lightweight Electron-based editor in the spirit of Sublime or Atom that provides a robust ecosystem of plugins that enables more of an IDE-like experience similar to its big brother Visual Studio. It is the dominant editor in many language communities, and has ecosystem support for just about every programming language at this point.

Here are a handful of key features

- Git and GitHub Integration
- IntelliSense Integration with most languages

These are good resources to get started with:

- [Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- [Intro Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos)

## Suggested Plugins

- [Microsoft C/C++ Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme)
- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)... Great for pair programming, but not for this class, per our academic honesty standards.
- [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer)

- [C/C++ for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)
- [Remote Development to local VM or remote server via SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh). You could use this to develop off VSCode in your host machine, and build in your Ubuntu VM.
