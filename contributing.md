## New programming tool?

If you're providing a new programming tool, continue in this section.
Please check all of these (and do the implied work):

- [ ] I have included a subdirectory for the programming tool
- [ ] I have included a `README.md` in the directory with the information spelled out in the highest-level `README.md`
- [ ] I have written the `README.md` in a way that is approachable for beginners
- [ ] I have simplified the configuration files to be useable and approachable by beginners

## Changes to existing tool directories

- [ ] I have maintained the usability of the tool for beginners
- [ ] If you added a new configuration specific for another tool (e.g. `vim` bindings), you have added a new configuration with an appropriate name (e.g. `tmux_vim_config`)
- [ ] I have tested to make sure that the configuration still works
